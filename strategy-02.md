I looked closely at the screenshot you shared. The trades shown are:

* **30th Sep 25400 PE** (Put option) – Bought
* **30th Sep 25600 PE** (Put option) – Bought

Both are **long Put positions** (buying Puts) with strikes **25400 and 25600**. Since both are **out-of-the-money Puts** and bought together, this structure is called a:

### **Long Put Spread (Bear Put Spread)**

* You buy a higher strike Put (25600 PE).
* You also buy a lower strike Put (25400 PE).
* This limits your maximum profit (difference between strikes – net premium) but reduces risk compared to naked option buying.

👉 In this screenshot, the trader is betting that **NIFTY will fall** before expiry, but instead of just one Put, they’ve created a **Put Spread** to balance risk/reward.

Would you like me to show you **step-by-step how to place this exact spread order in Zerodha Kite** (using “Basket Orders”), so you can replicate it?
