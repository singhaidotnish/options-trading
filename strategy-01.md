Looking at your screenshot and combining it with the backend code you shared (`angel_one.py`, `order_client_factory.py`), hereâ€™s the reasoning of what strategies are at play:

---

### 1. Structure of the positions

* **PE shorts (puts sold):**

  * 24800 PE (small size)
  * 24900 PE (big size)
  * 25000 PE (medium size)
  * 24500 PE (next week, large size)
  * 24800 PE (next week, small size)

* **CE shorts (calls sold):**

  * 25250 CE
  * 25300 CE
  * 25400 CE
  * 25450 CE
  * 25500 CE
  * 25600 CE (next week, small size)

ðŸ‘‰ This is **classic short strangles / straddles** with adjustments across strikes.

---

### 2. What the trader is doing here

* **Main position:** A wide **iron fly / short straddle cluster** around **NIFTY 25000â€“25300 zone**.
* **Put side is overloaded (big size at 24900, 25000)** â†’ means trader is betting that downside break below 24900 wonâ€™t happen.
* **Call side is layered (25250â€“25500)** â†’ risk-managed upside, selling multiple call strikes in ladder form.
* **Hedges**: Far OTM (24500 PE next week, 25600 CE next week) act as **protection wings** â†’ this converts naked shorts into **iron condors**.

---

### 3. Strategy names in play

* **Short Straddle / Strangle at ATM** (24900â€“25000 puts, 25250â€“25300 calls).
* **Iron Condor extensions** using outer wings (24500 PE, 25600 CE).
* **Ratio Spread feel**: Notice qty mismatch (e.g., â€“1050 puts vs â€“525 calls). This tilts payoff toward **bullish bias** (trader is more confident market wonâ€™t go too low).
* **Calendar spread component**: Mixing current expiry (30th Sep) with next week (7th Oct) adds a **time spread** â†’ roll-forward hedge.

---

### 4. What this means in simple words (ADHD-friendly ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥)

Think of it like this:

* At the center (NIFTY ~25000) â†’ they sold both calls & puts = collecting fat premium.
* To avoid blowing up if market goes wild â†’ they planted safety nets (24500 PE, 25600 CE).
* Bigger bet is **downside wonâ€™t crash** â†’ because put selling size is higher than calls.
* Upside â†’ layered with smaller call shorts, so risk is spread out.
* Net: **Short premium, slightly bullish iron condor with calendar protection.**

---

ðŸ‘‰ Man-to-man: this is a **premium eating machine**. As long as NIFTY hangs between 24900â€“25300 till expiry, the guy will keep pocketing lakhs. If a breakout happens â†’ hedges slow down bleeding, but still risky if size unmanaged.

---

Do you want me to **sketch the payoff chart** for this combo (24900â€“25300 short straddle + wings at 24500 & 25600)? That will make the strategy visually ADHD-digestible.
